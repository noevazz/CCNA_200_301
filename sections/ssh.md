# SSH

## What is SSH

Secure Shell (SSH) is a Layer 8 protocol used to access a remote computer securely.

With SSH we can stablish a secure connection to hide from malicious cyber-attacks, such as password-sniffing

It utilizes a client-server paradigm, in which clients and servers communicate via a secure channel.

Uses:

- Secure remote management
- Remote access to resources, software patches, and updates
- Router management
- Server hardware maintenance
- Virtualization platform administration
- Using a Virtual Private Network (VPN)


## How it works

SSH encrypts data before sending it through the network. SSH uses **public-key cryptography** to authenticate the client.

SSH uses three different encryption technologies:

- Symmetric encryption
- Asymmetric encryption
- Hashing
