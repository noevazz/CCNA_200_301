# Cryptology

Cryptology is the scientific study of Cryptography and Cryptoanalysis.

People often use cryptography to mean both.

        Cryptos = secret
        Logos = science

## Common terminology

- **Plain text**: Text that can be read by humans, it does not have any alteration.
- **Cypher text**: Text that has been passed for a encryption algorithm and it has completely no meaning when humans read it.
- **Hash**: Math operation over data that generates a string of fixed characters that represents the data. Hashes use one-way functions, which means you cannot get the data using the hash. Hashes are mostly used for data corruption (you can validate if the data you have is the expected by generating the hash and comparing it with the expected hash).

## Cryptography

Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties.

## Cryptoanalysis

Cryptoanalysis is the art of defeating cryptographic security systems, and gaining access to the contents of encrypted messages, without being given cryptographic key.
