## Peer to Peer

When a computer works as both, client and server

**Pros**
- Easy to set up
- Less complexity
- Lower cost (client and server in one)
- Used to simple task (sharing files)

**Cons**
- No centralized administration
- Not as secured
- Not scalable
- Slow performance

## Observer pattern


## Client server model

**Clients** are computers with software installed that enable them to *request and display information* (e.g. a web browser), from a server.

**Servers** are computers with software installed that enable them to provide information or services (email, storage, etc)
