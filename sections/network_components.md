# Network components

There are 3 fundamental components in a network:

- **Devices**: These are the physical elements, or hardware of the network. Examples are: phone, computer, printer, home router/modem, etc.
- **Media**: It provides a channel over which messages travels. Examples are: copper cables, fiber cables, radio frequency signals, etc.
- **Services and Processes**: Services include network applications people use every day and processes provide functionality that directs and move messages through the network.

### Devices

Devices are dived in 2 categories:

- **End devices**: The network devices that people are most familiar with are called end devices (PC, phone, etc).
    - An end device is either the source or destination of a message transmitted over the network
    - To distinguish one end device from another, each end device on a network is identified by an **address**.
- **Intermediary devices**: Connect the individual end devices to the network, and can connect multiple individual networks to form an internetwork.
    - Examples: Switch, router (determining the path that messages should take through internetworks), firewall, server, etc.
    - Main tasks:
        - Regenerate and re-transmit data signals
        - Maintain info about paths
        - Notify other devices of errors
        - Direct data along alternative pathways
        - Classify and direct message
        - Permit or deny the flow of data

### Media

The medium *provides the channel* over which the message *travels *from source to destination.

Types of media:

- **Wireless transmission**: Data is encoded using wavelengths from the electromagnetic spectrum.
- Metallic  wires within cables **(Copper)**: Data is encoded intro electrical impulses.
- Glass of plastic fibers (**fiber optic cable**): Data is encoded as pulse of light.

Criteria to consider when choosing network media:

- Distance 
- Environment
- Amount of data and speed
- Cost of installation


### Services and processes

**Services** include many of the common *network applications* people use every day.

**Processes**  provide the *functionality* that directs and moves the messages through the network.
